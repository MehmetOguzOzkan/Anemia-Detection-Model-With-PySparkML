# 🩸 Anemia Detection Model with PySparkML

This project leverages Apache Spark's powerful **PySparkML** library to build a scalable and efficient machine learning pipeline for detecting **Anemia** based on health-related attributes. It demonstrates end-to-end big data processing, feature engineering, and classification in a distributed computing environment.

## 📊 Overview

Anemia is a common blood disorder that affects the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells. Early and accurate detection is crucial for timely treatment.

This project provides:

- A **machine learning model** that classifies whether a patient has anemia.
- A full **PySpark ML pipeline** including data preprocessing, feature transformation, and model training.
- **Scalable** processing of large health datasets.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

The PySpark ML pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Data Loading** – Load dataset using Spark DataFrames.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle nulls, drop irrelevant features.
3. **Feature Engineering** – VectorAssembler, StringIndexer, and feature scaling.
4. **Model Training** – Train a Logistic Regression model.
5. **Evaluation** – Use accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score.
